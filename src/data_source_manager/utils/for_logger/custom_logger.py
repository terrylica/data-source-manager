    """Custom logger class that correctly identifies the actual source of log messages.

    This class overrides the standard findCaller method to properly identify where
    log messages are actually coming from in the application code, rather than showing
    the logging infrastructure's files (like logger_setup.py) as the source.

    This is especially important when:
    1. Using the show_filename feature to display source file information
    2. Working with proxy loggers or wrapper functions
    3. Building logging frameworks that should be "invisible" to the end user

    The findCaller method skips through frames in the logging module and this module
    to find the actual application code that initiated the logging call.
