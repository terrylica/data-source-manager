# FCP Demo Refactoring

## Important Note About Code Organization

The FCP (Failover Control Protocol (FCP)) Demo has been refactored to improve maintainability and code organization. This README explains the organization of the code and the transition from the legacy implementation to the refactored implementation.

## Code Organization

- **`fcp_demo.py`**: The current, refactored implementation (use this)
- **`legacy/fcp_demo_legacy.py`**: Legacy implementation (kept for reference only)
- **`fcp_demo_refactored.py`**: Temporary transitional file (will be removed in the future)

## Utility Modules

The refactoring extracted functionality into several utility modules with a `fcp_` prefix in the `utils/` directory:

- **`utils/fcp_time_utils.py`**: DateTime parsing and handling utilities
- **`utils/fcp_cache_utils.py`**: Cache directory management utilities
- **`utils/fcp_project_utils.py`**: Project path verification utilities
- **`utils/fcp_data_utils.py`**: Data fetching and processing utilities
- **`utils/fcp_display_utils.py`**: Result display and formatting utilities
- **`utils/fcp_cli_examples.py`**: CLI example management utilities

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Better Code Organization**: Functions are grouped logically by their purpose
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality is centralized in utility modules
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test individually
5. **Cleaner Main Script**: The main script is now focused on orchestration rather than implementation details

## Legacy Code Status

The legacy implementation has been moved to the `legacy/` directory and will be removed in a future release. It has been kept temporarily for reference purposes only. **Please do not use the legacy implementation for new code.**

A deprecation warning has been added to the legacy file that will display prominently if the file is executed.

## Usage

The refactored demo maintains the same command-line interface as the original, so existing scripts and documentation should continue to work:

```bash
./examples/dsm_sync_simple/fcp_demo.py -s BTCUSDT -m spot -i 1m
```

## Testing

A test script is provided to verify the utility modules work correctly:

```bash
./examples/dsm_sync_simple/test_fcp_refactored.py
```

## Future Improvements

The refactoring lays the groundwork for further enhancements:

1. Comprehensive unit tests for each utility module
2. Better error handling and recovery
3. More configurable logging options
4. Additional CLI commands and options
5. Interactive mode with real-time feedback and progress monitoring
