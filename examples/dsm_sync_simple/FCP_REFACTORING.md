# FCP Demo Refactoring

## Overview

The FCP (Failover Control Protocol (FCP)) Demo has been refactored to improve maintainability and code organization.
The refactoring extracts functionality into separate utility modules that follow a more modular design pattern.

## Refactored Structure

The refactoring creates several utility modules with a `fcp_` prefix in the `utils/` directory:

- **utils/fcp_time_utils.py**: DateTime parsing and handling utilities
- **utils/fcp_cache_utils.py**: Cache directory management utilities
- **utils/fcp_project_utils.py**: Project path verification utilities
- **utils/fcp_data_utils.py**: Data fetching and processing utilities
- **utils/fcp_display_utils.py**: Result display and formatting utilities
- **utils/fcp_cli_examples.py**: CLI example management utilities

The main demo script has been refactored as `examples/dsm_sync_simple/fcp_demo_refactored.py`,
which imports functionality from these utility modules.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Better Code Organization**: Functions are grouped logically by their purpose
3. **Reduced Duplication**: Common functionality is centralized in utility modules
4. **Enhanced Testability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to test individually
5. **Cleaner Main Script**: The main script is now focused on orchestration rather than implementation details

## Usage

The refactored demo can be used with the same command-line arguments as the original:

```bash
./examples/dsm_sync_simple/fcp_demo_refactored.py -s BTCUSDT -m spot -i 1m
```

## Testing

A test script is provided to verify the utility modules work correctly:

```bash
./examples/dsm_sync_simple/test_fcp_refactored.py
```

## Future Improvements

The refactoring lays the groundwork for further enhancements:

1. Comprehensive unit tests for each utility module
2. Better error handling and recovery
3. More configurable logging options
4. Additional CLI commands and options
5. Interactive mode with real-time feedback and progress monitoring
