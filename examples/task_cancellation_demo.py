"""
Task Cancellation Demo for EventBasedFetcher and ConcurrentFetcher.

This script demonstrates how task cancellation works in the EventBasedFetcher and
ConcurrentFetcher classes. It shows various cancellation scenarios:
1. Manual cancellation (explicitly calling cancel on tasks)
2. Timeout cancellation (tasks cancelled due to timeout)
3. Concurrent cancellation (cancellation propagation in parallel tasks)
4. Signal cancellation (handling Ctrl+C and other signals)
5. Event-based cancellation (using completion events without timeouts)

The demo includes a subclass of EventBasedFetcher that introduces an artificial
delay in the fetch process to make cancellation more observable.
