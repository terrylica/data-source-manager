# Path Finding Techniques for Executables

This project utilizes robust path-finding techniques to locate necessary executables across various Unix-like systems, including Linux, macOS, and compatible environments on Windows (like WSL or Git Bash).

1.  **Shell `command -v`**: This standard shell built-in command (`command -v <executable>`) searches the shell's `PATH` environment variable for the specified executable. It is a reliable method for finding system-wide or environment-specific commands (like a Python interpreter) that are in the shell's active PATH.

2.  **Python `shutil.which`**: Once a Python interpreter is located, the script uses Python's `shutil.which()` function (`shutil.which('<executable>')`) to find Python-specific executables (like `autoflake`) installed within that particular Python environment. This function also searches the PATH, but within the context of the executed Python process, ensuring that tools installed by `pip` within virtual environments are correctly found.

By combining these methods, the scripts effectively locate executables regardless of their specific installation path, relying on standard `PATH` mechanisms used by both the shell and Python environments.
