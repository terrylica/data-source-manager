# Python Preference

- Python 3.11 compatible functionality.

## CLI

- Always create demo or test as self-executable, shebang-enabled Python CLI tool (#!/usr/bin/env python3), designed with typer for command-line flag parsing (with enforced shorthand flags for all options where semantically appropriate), and requires executable permissions (chmod +x) to run directly without invoking the Python interpreter explicitly.
- Every one of the CLI flags should contain shorthand, including `-h` for `--help`.

## Statistics

- Only use terminal-based tools, such as `rich` Library, to generate statistics.

## Files

- Prefer `Pathlib` to `os`.

### Remote & Local

- Use `fsspec` for remote file and local path matching.

### Http client

- Prefer `httpx` to `requests` as http client.

## Logger

- You must not be allowed to  use `import logging` any where in the code.
- Apply `from utils.logger_setup import logger; from rich import print` as header imports for all Python scripts.
- Rich's `cosole.print()` is monkey patched to `print` via `utils/logger_setup.py` already.
