# Principles

Only focus on most low-hanging real-world user cases assuming the users don't make careless and low-level mistakes when using the target scripts.

- Remove non-essential test cases that are dealing with fringe issues.

## Rules

Make good use of caplog for PyTest.

- Never use any suppression or silencing techniques to avoid confronting errors or warnings.
- Don't deal with anything related to Options market data. Remove all concerns and codes related to options market.
- We trade spot and perpetual futures only but never futures with expiration date. Remove all concerns and codes related to futures with expiration dates.
- Cannot contain any business logics on its own but the purpose is to test the business logics of the target scripts
- Don't use any  pytest.skip(). Handle errors without skipping.
- Follow the principle that resources should be properly initialized and cleaned up, especially for network connections.

## Problem Solving Approach

On API related issues, always use CURL from terminal to find the root causes first.

- Resolve WARNING with options make available for me to choose from before proceeding further.
- When encoutering API related issues, use terminal-based Curl to find out more before making coding changes.


## No Mocking

Never use any mock data for PyTest cases but real-world data only.

- Always use actual integration tests against real components rather than mocked interactions.
- If certain tests can't be run due to external dependencies, properly document why with appropriate markers rather than mocking.
