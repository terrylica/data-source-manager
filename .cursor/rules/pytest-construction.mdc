# Principles

Only focus on most low-hanging real-world user cases.

## Rules

Make good use of `caplog` and `utils/logger_setup.py` for PyTest.

- Never use any suppression or silencing techniques to avoid confronting errors or warnings.
- Don't deal with anything related to Options market data. Remove all concerns and codes related to options market.
- We trade spot and perpetual futures only but never futures with expiration date. Remove all concerns and codes related to futures with expiration dates.
- Cannot contain any business logics on its own but the purpose is to test the business logics of the target scripts
- Don't use any pytest.skip(). Handle errors without skipping.
- Follow the principle that resources should be properly initialized and cleaned up, especially for network connections.
- **For pytest-asyncio, ensure consistent event loop behavior and prevent deprecation warnings by explicitly configuring `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function`. This configuration should be managed either in `pytest.ini` or directly within the test execution script (e.g., `run_tests_parallel.sh`) for self-contained test runs.**

## Problem Solving Approach

On API related issues, always use CURL from terminal to find the root causes first.

- Resolve WARNING with options make available for me to choose from before proceeding further.
- When encountering API related issues, use terminal-based Curl to find out more before making coding changes.
- Address deprecation warnings by properly configuring the library settings in configuration files or test execution scripts, rather than suppressing them with warning filters. **Prioritize explicit configuration to ensure consistent and future-proof test behavior.**


## No Mocking and No Sample Data

- Never use any sample or mock data for PyTest cases but real-world data only.
- Always use actual integration tests against real components rather than mocked interactions.
- We can accept synthetic test scenarios (e.g. for stress testing purposes) that still rely on real-world interfaces and data.
- If certain tests can't be run due to external dependencies, properly document why with appropriate markers rather than mocking.
