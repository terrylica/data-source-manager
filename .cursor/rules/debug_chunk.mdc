- Keep debug helper functions out of core files—-move them to `utils_for_debug/` and import as needed.

- Avoid leaving large chunks of inline debug code in core logic. Use conditional blocks, extract into helper functions under `utils_for_debug/`, or comment them with clear markers for reusability. This keeps the codebase clean while preserving traceability.

- Always seek to test iteratively and to debug automatically via Cursor Agent Yolo Mode.
