# Critical Bug Fix Report - DSM v0.1.44

## 🚨 URGENT BUG FIXED: Time Alignment Critical Error

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - System failure for hourly intervals  
**Version**: Fixed in v0.1.44  
**Impact**: 100% failure for 1h and 2h intervals, partial failures for other intervals

---

## Executive Summary

A **critical bug** in the time alignment logic was causing complete system failures for hourly intervals (1h, 2h) in DSM v0.1.43. The bug caused `start_time > end_time` errors, making data retrieval impossible for these intervals.

**The bug has been completely fixed in v0.1.44.**

## Issue Analysis

### 🔍 Root Cause

The bug was in the `align_time_boundaries` function in `src/data_source_manager/utils/time_utils.py`. The faulty logic was:

```python
# BUGGY CODE (v0.1.43)
# - startTime: Round UP to next interval boundary if not exactly on boundary
# - endTime: Round DOWN to previous interval boundary
aligned_start_microseconds = start_floor if start_microseconds == start_floor else start_floor + interval_microseconds
aligned_end_microseconds = end_floor
```

**Problem**: When the time range was shorter than the interval (e.g., 30-minute window with 1-hour interval):

- Start time gets rounded **UP** to next hour boundary
- End time gets rounded **DOWN** to previous hour boundary
- Result: `aligned_start > aligned_end` → **SystemError**

### 📊 Affected Intervals

| Interval | Status Before Fix | Status After Fix |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1s       | ✅ Working        | ✅ Working       |
| 1m       | ✅ Working        | ✅ Working       |
| 5m       | ✅ Working        | ✅ Working       |
| 15m      | ✅ Working        | ✅ Working       |
| **1h**   | ❌ **FAILED**     | ✅ **FIXED**     |
| **2h**   | ❌ **FAILED**     | ✅ **FIXED**     |

### 🔧 Error Details

**Error Message**:

```
ValueError: Start time (2025-06-02 20:00:00+00:00) must be before end time (2025-06-02 19:00:00+00:00)
```

**Stack Trace Location**:

```python
File "utils/for_core/rest_client_utils.py", line 220, in validate_request_params
    raise ValueError(f"Start time ({start_time}) must be before end time ({end_time})")
```

## Solution Implementation

### ✅ Fix Applied

Replaced the faulty alignment logic with corrected logic:

```python
# FIXED CODE (v0.1.44)
# - startTime: Round DOWN to interval boundary (floor)
# - endTime: Round DOWN to interval boundary (floor)
# This ensures aligned_start <= aligned_end always
aligned_start_microseconds = start_floor
aligned_end_microseconds = end_floor

# Ensure aligned_end is not before aligned_start
# If they're equal, we need at least one interval
if aligned_end_microseconds <= aligned_start_microseconds:
    aligned_end_microseconds = aligned_start_microseconds + interval_microseconds
```

### 🧪 Validation Results

**Before Fix (v0.1.43)**:

```
Testing 1h interval:
  ❌ BUG FOUND: aligned_start (2025-06-02 20:00:00+00:00) > aligned_end (2025-06-02 19:00:00+00:00)
     Time difference: 3600.0 seconds

Testing 2h interval:
  ❌ BUG FOUND: aligned_start (2025-06-02 20:00:00+00:00) > aligned_end (2025-06-02 18:00:00+00:00)
     Time difference: 7200.0 seconds
```

**After Fix (v0.1.44)**:

```
Testing 1h interval:
  ✅ OK: 2025-06-02 19:00:00+00:00 to 2025-06-02 20:00:00+00:00
     Duration: 3600.0 seconds

Testing 2h interval:
  ✅ OK: 2025-06-02 18:00:00+00:00 to 2025-06-02 20:00:00+00:00
     Duration: 7200.0 seconds
```

dsm = DataSourceManager.create(DataProvider.BINANCE, MarketType.SPOT)

# Previously failed for 1h/2h intervals, now works
data = dsm.get_data(
    symbol="BTCUSDT",
    start_time=start_time,
    end_time=end_time,
    interval=Interval.HOUR_1,  # Now works!
)
```
