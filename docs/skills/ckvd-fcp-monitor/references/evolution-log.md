# ckvd-fcp-monitor Evolution Log

Reverse-chronological log of skill improvements.

## 2026-02-10: Add scaffolding, fix cache paths, remove missing scripts

**Trigger**: Alignment audit against skill-architecture standards

**Changes**:

- Added TodoWrite Task Templates section (3 templates)
- Added Post-Change Checklist section
- Fixed cache diagnostic paths (was `~/.cache/ckvd`, now platformdirs path)
- Fixed cache_health.py to use platformdirs instead of hardcoded path
- Removed fcp_stats.py and warm_cache.py references (scripts never existed)

## 2026-01-30: Added adr field and evolution-log

**Trigger**: Adopting cc-skills patterns for skill self-evolution

**Changes**:

- Added `adr: docs/adr/2025-01-30-failover-control-protocol.md` to frontmatter
- Created `references/evolution-log.md` for tracking improvements
- Added link to evolution-log in Related section

**Rationale**: Skills should link to architectural decisions and track their own improvement history for maintainability.
