# Upgrades for `market_data_client.py` to Align with Vision API

## Low-Hanging Fruit & High Priority:\*\*

1. **Expand Interval Support to Match Vision API Intervals:**

   - **Description:** Currently, `market_data_client.py` might be optimized for 1-second data. Vision API supports a broader range of intervals (1s, 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 1M) for spot markets. The client should be enhanced to seamlessly handle all these intervals.
   - **Low Hangingness:** Relatively low. The code already uses the `Interval` enum and handles interval parameters. It mainly involves updating the supported intervals and ensuring the chunking and time alignment logic works correctly for all of them.
   - **Priority:** High. This is fundamental to aligning with Vision API's data availability and makes the client more generally useful.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Update the `Interval` enum in `utils/market_constraints.py` to include all Vision API intervals (if not already present).
     - Review and test the chunking logic in `_calculate_chunks` to ensure it works correctly for all intervals, especially larger ones like 1d, 1w, 1M.
     - Verify time alignment and bar duration validation (`_validate_bar_alignment`, `_validate_bar_duration`) are robust across all intervals.

2. **Data Schema Validation Against Vision API CSV Format:**

   - **Description:** Vision API provides data in CSV format within ZIP files. The `market_data_client.py` should validate that the data fetched from the REST API conforms to the same schema (column order, data types) as the Vision API CSV data.
   - **Low Hangingness:** Medium-low. Define the expected schema based on the Vision API CSV column description in `@binance_vision_klines.md`. Implement validation logic in `process_kline_data` or a new validation function.
   - **Priority:** High. Ensures data consistency and reliability, crucial for aligning with Vision API data standards.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Clearly define the expected schema (column names, data types, order) based on Vision API CSV format (refer to `@binance_vision_klines.md`).
     - In `process_kline_data`, add validation steps to check:
       - Number of columns matches the expected schema.
       - Column names are as expected and in the correct order.
       - Data types of each column are consistent with the expected types (numeric, timestamp, etc.).
     - Log warnings or errors if the schema validation fails.

3. **Enhance Documentation to Reflect Expanded Capabilities:**
   - **Description:** Update the documentation for `market_data_client.py` to clearly state the supported intervals, market types (currently SPOT-focused), and its alignment with Vision API data.
   - **Low Hangingness:** Low. Primarily documentation updates.
   - **Priority:** Medium. Important for usability and maintainability, especially as the client becomes more versatile.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Update docstrings for `EnhancedRetriever` and `fetch` method to reflect the expanded interval support and Vision API alignment.
     - Consider adding a section in the documentation that explicitly compares the data provided by `market_data_client.py` with Binance Vision API data.

## **Medium Hanging Fruit & Medium Priority:**

1. **Implement Basic Data Consistency Checks with Vision API (Sampling):**
   _**Description:** To ensure data consistency, implement checks that periodically compare data fetched by `market_data_client.py` (REST API) with sample data from Vision API (downloaded ZIP files) for the same symbol, interval, and date range. This would be a sampling approach, not a full data reconciliation, to detect major discrepancies.
   _ **Low Hangingness:** Medium. Requires implementing logic to download and parse Vision API ZIP files, extract CSV data, and compare it with the DataFrame from `market_data_client.py`. This is more complex than schema validation.
   _**Priority:** Medium. Provides a higher level of confidence in data accuracy and alignment with Vision API, but is more resource-intensive to implement. Start with sampling for key intervals and symbols.
   _ **Action Items:**
   _Create a utility function to download and extract CSV data from itertools import tee
   from Vision API ZIP files for a given symbol, interval, and date.
   _ Implement a data comparison function that takes a DataFrame from `market_data_client.py` and the corresponding Vision API data (e.g., for a specific day).
   _Compare key metrics (e.g., record count, average prices, volume sums) and potentially sample data rows to detect significant differences.
   _ Integrate this consistency check as an optional feature or a periodic test, logging any discrepancies.

2. **Improve Error Handling and Logging for Data Inconsistencies:**
   - **Description:** Enhance error handling to specifically catch and log data inconsistencies detected during schema validation or Vision API consistency checks. Provide more informative error messages to help diagnose data quality issues.
   - **Low Hangingness:** Medium-low. Involves refining existing error handling and logging, and adding new error conditions for data validation failures.
   - **Priority:** Medium. Improves robustness and debugging capabilities, especially when dealing with potential data quality issues or API changes.
   - **Action Items:**
     - Review existing error handling in `process_kline_data` and `EnhancedRetriever`.
     - Add specific error types or codes for schema validation failures and Vision API data consistency issues.
     - Enhance logging to include more context when data inconsistencies are detected (e.g., symbol, interval, date range, nature of discrepancy).

**Important Considerations for Vision API Alignment:**

- **Vision API Data Lag:** Remember that Vision API data is typically delayed by 48+ hours. Real-time or very recent data from the REST API will naturally be fresher than Vision API. The alignment should focus on historical data consistency.
- **Data Granularity Limits:** Ensure that when fetching data using `market_data_client.py`, you are not attempting to get data at a finer granularity or for a longer historical period than what is available in the Vision API for the same market type (spot). The goal is to be _consistent_ with Vision API's data availability, not to exceed it.

By prioritizing the low-hanging fruit first (interval expansion, schema validation, documentation), you can quickly make `market_data_client.py` more versatile and better aligned with the Binance Vision API data landscape. The medium-priority items (consistency checks, enhanced error handling) can be implemented iteratively to further improve data quality and robustness.

**Testing Structure:**

- All new interval support features (1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, etc.) should be tested in the `interval_new` test folder.
- The existing `interval_1s` test folder should be preserved exclusively for 1-second interval testing.
- When implementing new tests, use the fixtures and utilities already defined in the `interval_new/conftest.py` file, updating them as needed for specific interval requirements.
