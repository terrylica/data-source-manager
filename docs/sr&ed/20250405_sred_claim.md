# SR&ED Claim - Enhancing Data Retrieval Techniques in Raw Data Services

## Project Overview

This project was undertaken to develop a robust, high-performance data retrieval system within the Raw Data Services platform. The focus was on addressing challenges related to asynchronous resource management, efficient caching, and handling of various market data retrieval scenarios. Our custom solution enables immediate resource deallocation and reliable error handling, ensuring seamless operation even under high concurrency.

## Technical Challenges and Innovative Solutions

### Asynchronous Resource Cleanup and Management

- **Issue Identified:** Existing implementations exhibited hanging issues during asynchronous cleanup, especially when handling high-frequency REST and Vision API calls. Redundant cleanup methods and delayed resource releases led to performance degradation and potential resource leaks.

- **Our Approach:**
  - **Elimination of Redundant Cleanup:** Removed unnecessary cleanup logic from functions such as `example_fetch_historical_data`, leveraging the context manager's inherent cleanup capabilities.
  - **Refactoring `__aexit__` Methods:** Modified the `__aexit__` methods in key components (`RestDataClient`, `DataSourceManager`, and `VisionDataClient`) to adopt a direct cleanup strategy. Resources are captured, nullified immediately, and garbage collection is explicitly invoked to mitigate circular references.
  - **Improved Error Handling:** Implemented structured error logging and immediate handling of client shutdowns to ensure that even in error states, resource cleanup is prompt and deterministic.

### Caching and Data Integrity

- **Cache Management Enhancements:** Integrated a unified cache manager that accurately tracks cache hits, misses, and errors, ensuring high data retrieval performance and consistency across various data sources (e.g., REST and Vision APIs).

- **Testing Across Scenarios:** The solution was rigorously tested using multiple data retrieval examples:
  - Recent data fetching
  - Historical data retrieval with forced API source selection
  - Same-day intraday data
  - Handling of unavailable data (including future date requests and invalid symbols)

This comprehensive testing confirmed that the system reliably adheres to the expected behavior and gracefully handles edge cases while maintaining consistent data interfaces.

## Alternative Approaches Evaluated

During the development process, several off-the-shelf and alternative approaches were considered:

1. **Contextlib.AsyncExitStack:**

   - _Rationale:_ Initially, we explored using the standard `AsyncExitStack` for managing asynchronous cleanup.
   - _Shortcomings:_ This approach did not fully address the issue of immediate resource deallocation needed for Python 3.13 environments. The reliance on the event loop for delayed cleanup led to intermittent hanging issues, which were unacceptable for our high-concurrency requirements.

2. **Weak References for Cleanup:**

   - _Rationale:_ An alternative strategy involved using weak references to facilitate automatic garbage collection.
   - _Shortcomings:_ The inherent unpredictability in the timing of garbage collection made this approach unsuitable. Deterministic and immediate cleanup was critical for ensuring system stability and avoiding resource leaks.

3. **Existing Off-the-Shelf Solutions:**
   - _Evaluation:_ A market survey for generic resource management and caching libraries revealed that no available solution could address the specific combination of asynchronous cleanup, high-frequency data retrieval, and bespoke cache management demanded by our platform.
   - _Outcome:_ Off-the-shelf libraries either lacked the flexibility to integrate with our multi-source data environment or failed to provide the deterministic cleanup behavior essential for our application's reliability.

## Defensibility of the SR&ED Claim

The innovative aspects of our work lie in the custom solutions developed to overcome significant technical challenges:

- **Direct Asynchronous Cleanup:** By capturing resource references and invoking immediate cleanup processes, our solution prevents system hangs and ensures prompt release of resources, a capability not provided by standard libraries.

- **Tailored Cache Management:** The unified cache manager is custom-built to handle the unique requirements of our data retrieval system, including precise tracking of cache statistics across multiple data sources and instances.

- **Robust Error Handling:** Enhanced error logging and immediate exception handling ensure that even under adverse conditions (such as future date requests or invalid symbols), the system remains stable and consistent.

These innovations demonstrate a substantive technological advancement that meets and exceeds the project requirements, providing clear evidence of both novelty and improved performance over existing solutions.

## Conclusion

The project successfully addressed critical gaps in asynchronous resource management and data retrieval for cryptocurrency market data. Our systematic approach—coupled with rigorous testing and evaluation of alternative methods—resulted in a highly reliable and defensible solution. The absence of adequate off-the-shelf alternatives further underscores the innovative nature of our development process and the significance of the advancements achieved. This write-up serves as a comprehensive record of the technical challenges, solutions implemented, and the thorough evaluation of alternative approaches, thereby reinforcing the SR&ED claim for this project.
