# Claude Code Infrastructure for AI-Assisted Development

## Context and Problem Statement

Data Source Manager is a complex package with domain-specific patterns (FCP, timestamp handling, symbol formats) that require context for effective AI-assisted development. How do we structure documentation and tooling to maximize Claude Code effectiveness?

## Decision Drivers

- Reduce context pollution in main CLAUDE.md
- Enable progressive disclosure for detailed topics
- Provide specialized agents for common tasks
- Ensure domain rules are loaded only when relevant
- Follow established patterns from cc-skills

## Considered Options

1. **Monolithic CLAUDE.md** - All instructions in one file
2. **Wiki-style docs** - Separate markdown files without Claude Code integration
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Skills, agents, rules, and commands structure

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Progressive Disclosure** with Claude Code infrastructure because it provides the best balance of discoverability and context efficiency.

```

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

1. **CLAUDE.md** (<300 lines) - Quick reference, navigation, critical rules
2. **Skills** (SKILL.md) - Task-specific guidance with examples and references
3. **Context Rules** (.claude/rules/) - Domain-specific guidance loaded on demand
4. **Agents** (.claude/agents/) - Specialized subagents for delegation
5. **Commands** (.claude/commands/) - Slash commands for common workflows

### Key Patterns

**Skills with @ Imports**:

```markdown
## References

- @references/fcp-protocol.md - Detailed FCP documentation
- @examples/basic-fetch.md - Usage examples
```

**Context Rules with YAML Frontmatter**:

```yaml
---
name: dsm-research
context: fork
agent: Explore
user-invocable: true
---
```

### Consequences

**Good:**

- CLAUDE.md stays concise and scannable
- Domain rules only loaded when relevant
- Specialized agents handle complex tasks
- Scripts provide runnable examples
- Consistent with cc-skills patterns

**Bad:**

- More files to maintain
- Requires understanding of Claude Code features
- @ imports require specific syntax
