# Comprehensive Bybit REST API Endpoints Documentation

This document provides detailed information about Bybit's REST API endpoints for retrieving market data, based on empirical testing and analysis of response structures.

## 1. API Fundamentals

Bybit offers REST API endpoints for accessing market data including candlestick (kline) data for various intervals. This document focuses on the structure, parameters, and response format of these endpoints.

### 1.1 Available Endpoints Overview

Bybit offers several market types with a unified REST API structure:

| Market Type | Category Parameter | Description                             | Symbol Naming Convention                           |
| ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Spot        | `spot`             | Spot trading pairs                      | Base currency + Quote currency (e.g., `BTCUSDT`)   |
| Linear      | `linear`           | Perpetual contracts settled in USDT     | Base currency + `USDT` (e.g., `BTCUSDT`)          |
| Inverse     | `inverse`          | Perpetual contracts settled in the coin | Base currency + `USD` (e.g., `BTCUSD`)            |
| Option      | `option`           | Options trading                         | Various formats based on expiry and strike price   |

**Important Note on Naming Conventions:**
- **Inverse Perpetual Contracts**: Use `USD` suffix (not `USDT`), such as `BTCUSD`, `ETHUSD`, `XRPUSD`
- **Linear Perpetual Contracts**: Use `USDT` suffix, such as `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `XRPUSDT`
- Each market type has its own distinct symbol format which must be adhered to when making API requests

**Common Symbols by Category (Based on Empirical Testing):**
- **Inverse (`category=inverse`)**: `BTCUSD`, `ETHUSD`, `XRPUSD`, `BTCUSDM25` (monthly futures), `BTCUSDU25` (quarterly futures)
- **Linear (`category=linear`)**: `BTCUSDT`, `ETHUSDT`, `XRPUSDT`, `BTCPERP` (perpetual), `BTCUSDT-26DEC25` (dated futures)

Note that naming conventions must be strictly followed when making API requests, as using an incorrect symbol format (e.g., requesting `BTCUSDT` in the inverse category) will result in empty responses.

**⚠️ Critical API Behavior Warning:**

Our empirical testing has revealed a potentially misleading behavior in the Bybit API:
- When using `category=inverse` with a USDT-suffixed symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT), the API **does not return an error**
- Instead, it returns data from the linear market while incorrectly labeling it as "category": "inverse" in the response
- The data returned is identical to what would be returned from a `category=linear` request with the same symbol
- This behavior creates a risk of unintentionally analyzing linear market data when inverse market data was intended

Always validate that you're using the correct symbol format for each market category to ensure data integrity.

### 1.2 API URL Structure

The Bybit REST API uses a unified URL pattern for all market types, with the market type specified in the `category` parameter.

#### 1.2.1 URL Pattern

Base URL: `https://api.bybit.com`

Path: `/v5/market/kline`

Complete URL pattern: `https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/kline?category={category}&symbol={symbol}&interval={interval}&start={startTime}&end={endTime}&limit={limit}`

Example: `https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/kline?category=linear&symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=5&start=1715000000000&end=1715100000000&limit=10`

**Examples by Market Type:**

1. **Linear Perpetual (USDT-settled)**:  
   `https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/kline?category=linear&symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=5&start=1715000000000&end=1715100000000&limit=10`

2. **Inverse Perpetual (Coin-settled)**:  
   `https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/kline?category=inverse&symbol=BTCUSD&interval=5&start=1715000000000&end=1715100000000&limit=10`

3. **Spot Market**:  
   `https://api.bybit.com/v5/market/kline?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT&interval=5&start=1715000000000&end=1715100000000&limit=10`

#### 1.2.2 Key Observations

- Bybit uses a unified REST API structure across all market types
- The `category` parameter determines which market type is queried
- Timestamps are in milliseconds (Unix timestamp format)
- The response format is consistent across market types

## 2. Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type    | Required | Description                                                                           |

### 2.1 Interval Values

Bybit uses numeric values for minute-based intervals and single letters for larger timeframes:

| Interval Value | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| 1              | 1 minute    |
| 3              | 3 minutes   |
| 5              | 5 minutes   |
| 15             | 15 minutes  |
| 30             | 30 minutes  |
| 60             | 1 hour      |
| 120            | 2 hours     |
| 240            | 4 hours     |

| D              | 1 day       |
| W              | 1 week      |
| M              | 1 month     |

### 2.2 Timestamp Handling

- All timestamps are in milliseconds (Unix timestamp format)
- The API appears to round timestamps to the nearest interval boundary
- For 5-minute intervals, timestamps align to 00:00, 00:05, 00:10, etc.
- For 15-minute intervals, timestamps align to 00:00, 00:15, 00:30, 00:45, etc.

## 3. Response Structure

### 3.1 Response Format

```json
{
  "retCode": 0,
  "retMsg": "OK",
  "result": {
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "category": "linear",
    "list": [
      [
        "1715100000000", // Timestamp (ms)
        "63538.4", // Open price
        "63571.5", // High price
        "63510.1", // Low price
        "63528.5", // Close price
        "183.198", // Volume
        "11639163.7632" // Turnover (volume in quote currency)
      ]
      // Additional klines...
    ]
  },
  "retExtInfo": {},
  "time": 1748500535631 // Server timestamp
}
```

### 3.2 Kline Data Format

Each kline in the response `list` is an array with 7 elements:

| Index | Description                         | Type   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ------ |
| 0     | Timestamp (milliseconds)            | string |
| 1     | Open price                          | string |
| 2     | High price                          | string |
| 3     | Low price                           | string |
| 4     | Close price                         | string |
| 5     | Volume (in base currency)           | string |
| 6     | Turnover (volume in quote currency) | string |

### 3.3 Empty Response

When no data is available for the requested time range (e.g., for very old dates or future dates), the API returns an empty list rather than an error:

```json
{
  "retCode": 0,
  "retMsg": "OK",
  "result": {
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "category": "linear",
    "list": []
  },
  "retExtInfo": {},
  "time": 1748500528559
}
```

## 4. Historical Data Availability

Based on empirical testing using the Bybit REST API, historical data availability for specific trading pairs and intervals depends on when the pair was first listed and the market type (Spot, Linear, Inverse). Our investigation employed a precise command-line methodology to pinpoint the earliest available data for key BTC pairs at 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute intervals.

### 4.1 Earliest Data by Market and Interval (Empirical Findings)

| Market Type       | Symbol  | Interval   | Earliest Available Timestamp (UTC)                   | Notes                                                |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Spot              | BTCUSDT | 1 minute   | 2021-07-05 12:00:00                                 |                                                      |
| Spot              | BTCUSDT | 5 minutes  | 2021-07-05 12:00:00                                 |                                                      |
| Spot              | BTCUSDT | 15 minutes | 2021-07-05 12:00:00                                 |                                                      |
| Linear Perpetual  | BTCUSDT | 1 minute   | 2020-03-25 10:36:00                                 | Verified first active data at 2020-03-25 10:36:00    |
| Linear Perpetual  | BTCUSDT | 5 minutes  | 2020-03-25 10:35:00                                 |                                                      |
| Linear Perpetual  | BTCUSDT | 15 minutes | 2020-03-25 10:30:00                                 |                                                      |
| Inverse Perpetual | BTCUSD  | 1 minute   | 2018-11-14 16:00:00                                 | Initial record with zero volume, active trading      |
|                   |         |            |                                                     | begins at 2018-11-14 22:00:00 with volume data       |
| Inverse Perpetual | BTCUSD  | 5 minutes  | 2018-11-14 16:00:00                                 | Similar pattern to 1-minute data                     |
| Inverse Perpetual | BTCUSD  | 15 minutes | 2018-11-14 16:00:00                                 | Similar pattern to 1-minute data                     |
| Inverse Perpetual | ETHUSD  | 1 minute   | 2019-01-25 00:00:00                                 | Added based on empirical testing                     |

**Note:** While our testing provides precise earliest times based on API responses, the official listing dates announced by Bybit may slightly predate the availability of granular kline data in the API. Initial records may have zero volume before active trading begins.

### 4.2 Methodology for Determining Earliest Data

To determine the earliest available timestamp for a given trading pair and interval, we employed a precise command-line based methodology using `curl` and `jq`. This method focuses on identifying the _very first_ kline returned by the API when querying from a point in time known to be before the data's existence.

1.  **Initial Query:** We sent a `GET` request to the `/v5/market/kline` endpoint with a very early `start` timestamp (e.g., 2015-01-01) and specifically set the `limit=1`. The API is expected to return the first available kline at or after the provided `start` timestamp. If the result list is empty, it indicates data does not go back to that `start` time.
2.  **Identify Potential Earliest:** The timestamp of the single kline returned by the initial query (if a kline was returned) was considered the potential earliest available timestamp. This timestamp represents the beginning of the first kline found by the API from our very early starting point.
3.  **Rigorous Verification:** To confirm this was the absolute earliest available kline via the API for the specific interval, we performed a crucial verification step. We sent a subsequent query with the `start` timestamp set to be exactly **one interval (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 15 minutes)** _before_ the potential earliest timestamp found in step 2, again with `limit=1`. If this verification query returned an _empty list_, it definitively confirmed that data does not exist before the potential earliest timestamp found in step 2, thus validating it as the true earliest available time via the API for that interval. If a kline was returned in the verification step, its timestamp would become the new potential earliest, and the verification process would be repeated.

This rigorous methodology was applied to the specific pairs and intervals listed above to generate the empirical findings, providing high confidence in the reported earliest available timestamps through the Bybit REST API.

## 5. Rate Limiting

Bybit implements rate limiting on their API. Based on their official documentation:

- Rate limits are applied per IP address
- Different endpoints have different rate limit weights
- The `/v5/market/kline` endpoint is subject to these rate limits

### 5.1 Rate Limit Headers

Bybit returns rate limit information in response headers:

- `X-Bapi-Limit`: The rate limit for the current endpoint
- `X-Bapi-Limit-Status`: Current usage count
- `X-Bapi-Limit-Reset-Timestamp`: Timestamp when the rate limit will reset

### 5.2 Rate Limit Errors

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns an error response with:

```json
{
  "retCode": 10006,
  "retMsg": "Too many visits!"
}
```

## 6. Best Practices

### 6.1 Handling Historical Data

1. When requesting historical data, start with smaller time ranges to test availability
2. For large date ranges, consider paginating requests with appropriate `limit` values
3. Handle empty responses gracefully, as they indicate no data is available for the requested range

### 6.2 Market-Specific Symbol Handling

1. Always use the correct symbol format for the specific market category:
   - Use `BTCUSD` (not `BTCUSDT`) for inverse perpetual contracts
   - Use `BTCUSDT` (not `BTCUSD`) for linear perpetual contracts
2. When switching between market types, ensure that symbol names are adjusted accordingly
3. When building a comprehensive data retrieval system, implement validation to prevent requesting invalid symbol-category combinations
4. Test symbol availability with small queries before initiating large-scale data retrieval operations
5. **Be aware of misleading API responses**: Our empirical testing showed that querying `category=inverse` with USDT-suffixed symbols returns linear market data incorrectly labeled as "inverse"
6. **Implement validation checks**: Applications should verify both the requested and returned category/symbol combinations to prevent data integrity issues

### 6.3 Rate Limit Management

1. Monitor rate limit headers in responses to track usage
2. Implement backoff strategies when approaching rate limits
3. Consider implementing request queuing for high-volume applications

### 6.4 Error Handling

1. Always check the `retCode` field in responses to verify success
2. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limit errors
3. Log unusual empty responses for investigation

## 7. Comparison with Other Endpoints

Bybit offers several other market data endpoints that may be useful depending on your use case:

- `/v5/market/tickers`: For current market prices and 24-hour statistics
- `/v5/market/trades`: For recent trades
- `/v5/market/orderbook`: For current order book data

Each endpoint has its own rate limits and response formats. Choose the appropriate endpoint based on your specific data needs.

## 8. Conclusion

The Bybit REST API provides a unified structure for accessing kline data across all market types. Understanding the request parameters, response format, and rate limit considerations will help you effectively integrate Bybit market data into your applications.
