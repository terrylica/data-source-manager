## URL Structure

The Binance Vision API follows a consistent URL structure for accessing historical kline data, with different formats depending on the market type:

### Spot Market URL Format

```url
https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/klines/{SYMBOL}/{INTERVAL}/{SYMBOL}-{INTERVAL}-{DATE}.zip
```

And the corresponding checksum file:

```url
https://data.binance.vision/data/spot/daily/klines/{SYMBOL}/{INTERVAL}/{SYMBOL}-{INTERVAL}-{DATE}.zip.CHECKSUM
```

### USDT-Margined Futures (UM) URL Format

```url
https://data.binance.vision/data/futures/um/daily/klines/{SYMBOL}/{INTERVAL}/{SYMBOL}-{INTERVAL}-{DATE}.zip
```

And the corresponding checksum file:

```url
https://data.binance.vision/data/futures/um/daily/klines/{SYMBOL}/{INTERVAL}/{SYMBOL}-{INTERVAL}-{DATE}.zip.CHECKSUM
```

### Coin-Margined Futures (CM) URL Format

```url
https://data.binance.vision/data/futures/cm/daily/klines/{SYMBOL}_PERP/{INTERVAL}/{SYMBOL}_PERP-{INTERVAL}-{DATE}.zip
```

And the corresponding checksum file:

```url
https://data.binance.vision/data/futures/cm/daily/klines/{SYMBOL}_PERP/{INTERVAL}/{SYMBOL}_PERP-{INTERVAL}-{DATE}.zip.CHECKSUM
```

Where:

- `{SYMBOL}`: The trading pair (e.g., BTCUSDT for spot and UM, BTCUSD for CM)
- `{INTERVAL}`: One of the supported intervals from the table above
- `{DATE}`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Note that for Coin-Margined Futures (CM), the symbol includes a `_PERP` suffix for perpetual contracts.

## Example URLs

Here are example URLs for accessing kline data for different market types:

```

## Checksum Format and Verification

Each data file is accompanied by a corresponding SHA-256 checksum file (with a `.zip.CHECKSUM` extension). The format of the checksum file is:

```tree
<sha256_hash>  <filename>
```

For example:

```tree
d0a6fd261d2bf9c6c61b113714724e682760b025c449b19c90a1c4f00ede3e9c  BTCUSDT-1m-2025-04-13.zip
```

To verify the integrity of a downloaded data file:

1. Download both the data file (`.zip`) and its corresponding checksum file (`.zip.CHECKSUM`)
2. Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded data file
3. Compare it with the hash in the checksum file
4. If they match, the file integrity is verified

This verification ensures that the data has not been corrupted during download or transmission.

## Data Format

The downloaded ZIP files contain CSV data. The format of these files varies based on the market type and year:

### Spot Market (2020-2024)

For spot market data from 2020 to 2024, the files do not include column headers. The data follows this structure:

1. Open time (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
2. Open price
3. High price
4. Low price
5. Close price
6. Volume
7. Close time (Unix timestamp in milliseconds)
8. Quote asset volume
9. Number of trades
10. Taker buy base asset volume
11. Taker buy quote asset volume
12. Ignore

Example from 2023:

```csv
1672531200000,16541.77000000,16544.76000000,16538.45000000,16543.67000000,83.08143000,1672531259999,1374268.84886160,2687,40.18369000,664706.01106360,0
```

### Spot Market (2025 and later)

Starting from 2025, spot market data uses microsecond precision for timestamps:

1. Open time (Unix timestamp in microseconds)
2. Open price
3. High price
4. Low price
5. Close price
6. Volume
7. Close time (Unix timestamp in microseconds)
8. Quote asset volume
9. Number of trades
10. Taker buy base asset volume
11. Taker buy quote asset volume
12. Ignore

Example from 2025:

```csv
1735689600000000,93576.00000000,93610.93000000,93537.50000000,93610.93000000,8.21827000,1735689659999999,768978.75522470,2631,3.95157000,369757.32652890,0
```

### Futures Markets (UM and CM)

For futures markets, there are differences between USDT-Margined (UM) and Coin-Margined (CM) formats:

#### USDT-Margined Futures Data Format

- Newer files (2023+) include column headers
- Older files (2020) do not include headers
- Uses millisecond precision timestamps (13 digits)

Example from 2023:

```csv
open_time,open,high,low,close,volume,close_time,quote_volume,count,taker_buy_volume,taker_buy_quote_volume,ignore
1672531200000,16537.50,16538.00,16534.30,16538.00,170.576,1672531259999,2820697.45580,946,103.782,1716164.80590,0
```

#### Coin-Margined Futures Data Format

- CM futures data consistently includes column headers from at least 2020 through 2025
- Uses millisecond precision timestamps (13 digits) for all years including 2025
- Unlike spot data, CM futures data does not switch to microsecond precision in 2025

Example from 2021:

```csv
open_time,open,high,low,close,volume,close_time,quote_volume,count,taker_buy_volume,taker_buy_quote_volume,ignore
1609459200000,28950.4,28996.1,28942.3,28993.1,10650,1609459259999,36.75817005,261,5883,20.30742194,0
```

Example from 2025:

```csv
open_time,open,high,low,close,volume,close_time,quote_volume,count,taker_buy_volume,taker_buy_quote_volume,ignore
1735689600000,93422.4,93463.2,93390.2,93463.2,7349,1735689659999,7.86650390,154,6685,7.15560836,0
```

Note that older files from September 2020 don't include column headers:

```csv
1598918400000,11663.4,11672.9,11662.6,11672.9,491,1598918459999,4.20892982,24,431,3.69449051,0
```

## Cache Management

The Data Source Manager includes utilities for cache management using the `CacheKeyManager` class. The following cache key format and path structure is used when caching data:

### Cache Data Key Format

```python
# Key format: {exchange}_{market_type}_{data_nature}_{packaging_frequency}_{symbol}_{interval}_{YYYY-MM-DD}
cache_key = f"{exchange}_{market_type}_{data_nature}_{packaging_frequency}_{symbol}_{interval}_{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}"
```

### Cache Path Structure

```python
# Path structure: {cache_dir}/{exchange}/{market_type}/{data_nature}/{packaging_frequency}/{symbol}/{interval}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.arrow
cache_path = cache_dir / exchange / market_type / data_nature / packaging_frequency / symbol / interval / f"{date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.arrow"
```

### Cache File Format

Data is cached in Apache Arrow format (`.arrow` files) for efficient storage and retrieval. This format provides:

1. Faster read/write operations compared to CSV
2. Lower memory usage for large datasets
3. Column-oriented storage for optimized query performance
4. Preserved data types and schema

#### Arrow File Structure

The Arrow cache files maintain a standardized schema:

| Column Name            | Data Type     | Description                                        | Index |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| open_time              | Timestamp[ns] | Candle open time (used as index with UTC timezone) | Yes   |
| open                   | Float64       | Opening price of the candle                        | No    |
| high                   | Float64       | Highest price during the candle period             | No    |
| low                    | Float64       | Lowest price during the candle period              | No    |
| close                  | Float64       | Closing price of the candle                        | No    |
| volume                 | Float64       | Trading volume during the candle period            | No    |
| close_time             | Timestamp[ns] | Candle close time (with UTC timezone)              | No    |
| quote_asset_volume     | Float64       | Volume in the quote currency                       | No    |
| count                  | Int64         | Number of trades executed during the period        | No    |
| taker_buy_base_volume  | Float64       | Base asset volume from taker buy orders            | No    |
| taker_buy_quote_volume | Float64       | Quote asset volume from taker buy orders           | No    |

#### Data Processing and Storage

When data is cached:

1. The DataFrame is indexed by `open_time` with UTC timezone
2. Duplicate records are removed to ensure data integrity
3. A SHA-256 checksum is generated and stored for data verification
4. Records are sorted by the `open_time` index to maintain temporal order
5. Each Arrow file corresponds to a single day's data for a specific symbol and interval

#### Reading Cached Data

The `VisionCacheManager` provides utilities for reading cached data with features such as:

- Memory mapping for efficient loading of large files
- Optional column filtering to reduce memory usage
- Automatic timezone handling (ensuring UTC timezone)
- Index validation and sorting

The `SafeMemoryMap` context manager ensures proper resource cleanup when accessing cached Arrow files.

The `VisionCacheManager` handles saving and loading data with features like:

- SHA-256 checksums for data integrity verification
- Duplicate record removal
- Memory-efficient loading using memory mapping
- Column filtering for reduced memory usage

## Integration with Data Source Manager

These kline intervals can be used with the Data Source Manager to fetch and cache historical candlestick data. When configuring data sources, use the interval values from the "URL Path Component" column in the table above.

## Verification

All intervals listed in this document were verified as available by testing API endpoint responses on the date of document creation.

## Timestamp Boundaries and Behavior

Based on direct testing with the Binance Vision API, we've observed the following timestamp behavior across different intervals:

### Raw Data Timestamp Structure

For each interval type, the raw data files follow these timestamp patterns:

1. **All intervals start at interval boundaries**: The first data point in each file corresponds to the first interval boundary of the day.

   - For 1s intervals: First timestamp is exactly 00:00:00
   - For 1m intervals: First timestamp is exactly 00:00:00
   - For 3m intervals: First timestamp is exactly 00:00:00
   - For 5m intervals: First timestamp is exactly 00:00:00
   - For 15m intervals: First timestamp is exactly 00:00:00
   - For 1h intervals: First timestamp is exactly 00:00:00

2. **Timestamp semantic meaning**:

   - `open_time` (first column): Represents the **beginning** of the candle period
   - `close_time` (7th column): Represents the **end** of the candle period

3. **Timestamp precision**:
   - 2023 and earlier: Millisecond precision (13 digits, e.g., `1678838400000`)
   - 2025 and later: Microsecond precision (16 digits, e.g., `1741996800000000`)

### Timestamp Alignment

When processing these timestamps, it's important to preserve their semantic meaning:

```text
First candle for 1m interval (2023):
open_time: 1678838400000 (2023-03-15 00:00:00+00:00) - Beginning of candle
close_time: 1678838459999 (2023-03-15 00:00:59.999+00:00) - End of candle
```

```text
First candle for 1m interval (2025):
open_time: 1741996800000000 (2025-03-15 00:00:00+00:00) - Beginning of candle
close_time: 1741996859999999 (2025-03-15 00:00:59.999999+00:00) - End of candle
```

When implementing applications that use this data, ensure that:

1. Timestamps are interpreted as the **beginning** of the candle period
2. Proper handling accounts for different precision between pre-2025 and 2025+ data
3. When filtering by time ranges, the temporal semantics of the timestamps are preserved

### Timestamp Conversion Considerations

When converting timestamps to datetime objects:

```python
# For millisecond precision (2023 and earlier)
from datetime import datetime, timezone
millisecond_ts = 1678838400000  # From 2023 data
dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(millisecond_ts / 1000, tz=timezone.utc)
# Result: 2023-03-15 00:00:00+00:00

# For microsecond precision (2025 and later)
microsecond_ts = 1741996800000000  # From 2025 data
dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(microsecond_ts / 1000000, tz=timezone.utc)
# Result: 2025-03-15 00:00:00+00:00
```

## Interval Boundary Behavior

For applications that need to fetch and merge data across time boundaries, understanding how the Binance Vision API structures these boundaries is crucial:

1. **Daily files contain all intervals that start within that day**:

   - A 1m candle starting at 23:59:00 on March 15 will be in the March 15 file, even though it ends at 00:00:00 on March 16
   - A 1h candle starting at 23:00:00 on March 15 will be in the March 15 file, even though it ends at 00:00:00 on March 16

2. **First interval behavior**:
   - For 1s intervals: The file contains data starting from 00:00:00
   - For 1m intervals: The file contains data starting from 00:00:00
   - For larger intervals: The file contains data starting from 00:00:00

When implementing data processing systems, these boundary behaviors should be carefully considered to avoid missing or duplicating data when working across day boundaries.
