# Memory Monitoring System

## Introduction

The Memory Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution for monitoring, diagnosing, and optimizing memory usage in the Raw Data Services infrastructure. This project evolves from the successful diagnostic garbage collection tools developed in playground demos.

## Key Documentation

- [Implementation Plan](plan.md) - Detailed roadmap for productionizing memory monitoring
- [Current Prototype](../../debugging/Python3_13_Resource_Cleanup.md) - Background on resource cleanup issues
- [curl_cffi Specific Fixes](../../debugging/Curl_CFFI_Hanging_Fix.md) - Addressing curl_cffi-specific memory issues

## Overview

The Memory Monitoring System will provide:

1. **Real-time Memory Usage Tracking**

   - Continuous monitoring of RSS and virtual memory usage
   - Per-component resource tracking
   - Long-term trend analysis

2. **Advanced Diagnostics**

   - Memory leak detection
   - Reference cycle identification
   - curl_cffi resource tracking
   - Automatic diagnostic garbage collection

3. **Integration**
   - Alerting on anomalies
   - Metrics dashboards
   - Log enrichment

## Current Status

Initial prototype development is complete with the following components:

- `diagnostic_gc_run()` - Diagnostic garbage collection with metrics
- `MemoryMonitor` class - Basic memory usage monitoring and alerting

This prototype has successfully validated the core concepts and demonstrated the ability to:

- Track memory usage over time
- Detect and log memory growth trends
- Create and detect artificial reference cycles
- Log detailed memory statistics to JSONL files

## Next Steps

The roadmap outlines the transition from prototype to production. Key milestones include:

1. Creating production-ready modules in the `utils` directory
2. Integrating with existing monitoring infrastructure
3. Implementing alerting and visualization
4. Deploying across all production services

See [plan.md](plan.md) for detailed implementation timeline and technical specifications.
