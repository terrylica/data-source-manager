# Utility Consolidation Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the utility module consolidation project, which aims to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and enhance consistency across the codebase.

## Contents

- **[plan.md](plan.md)** - The original project roadmap outlining the consolidation strategy, phases, and implementation plan
- **[status.md](status.md)** - Current status of the consolidation effort, progress made, and remaining tasks

## Overview

The utility consolidation project restructured scattered utility functions into logically organized modules:

1. **time_utils.py** - Consolidation of time-related functions
2. **validation_utils.py** - Consolidation of validation functions
3. **network_utils.py** - Consolidation of HTTP client and download handling

## Benefits

- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability
- Clear dependency tree
- Simplified module relationships
- Better named and documented functions

## Testing

Tests for the consolidated utility modules can be run using:

```bash
# Run all tests
scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh tests

# Run specific utility tests
scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh tests/network_utils
scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh tests/validation_utils
scripts/run_tests_parallel.sh tests/time_utils
```
