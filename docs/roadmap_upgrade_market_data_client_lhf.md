# Enhanced Roadmap for Market Data Client Upgrades

After reviewing all the code files (`cache_manager.py`, `data_source_manager.py`, `market_data_client.py`, `vision_constraints.py`, `vision_data_client.py`) alongside the documentation, I'm proposing the following enhanced roadmap that better aligns with your requirement to make the market data client more versatile without disrupting the existing interface while ensuring consistency with Vision API data limitations.

## High Priority & Low-Hanging Fruit

### 1. Expand Market Support Beyond SPOT Market (While Respecting Vision API Limitations)

- **Description:** The current `EnhancedRetriever` in `market_data_client.py` is SPOT-focused and rejects non-SPOT markets. Expand to support USDT-M and COIN-M futures markets, but only when comparable data is available via Vision API.
- **Low Hangingness:** Medium-low. The code has validation for market type but needs modification.
- **Priority:** High. This significantly expands versatility while maintaining alignment with Vision API.
- **Action Items:**
  - Modify `__init__` to accept other market types beyond SPOT
  - Update market capability checks to use `get_market_capabilities()` without automatically rejecting non-SPOT markets
  - Reference `vision_constraints.py` to ensure market type limitations align with Vision API availability

### 2. Comprehensive Interval Support Based on Vision API Availability

- **Description:** Enhance interval support to match exactly what Vision API provides (1s, 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 1M), with proper enforcement of market-specific limitations.
- **Low Hangingness:** Low. The `Interval` enum is already used consistently.
- **Priority:** High. Fundamental for alignment and versatility.
- **Action Items:**
  - Update chunking logic in `_calculate_chunks()` to handle all intervals properly
  - Add a validation step that references Vision API's available intervals by market type
  - Modify time boundary calculations for all intervals to ensure proper alignment

### 3. Implement Column Schema Standardization with Vision API

- **Description:** Ensure the column schema from REST API precisely matches Vision API's CSV format for seamless interchangeability.
- **Low Hangingness:** Low. The code already has column standardization in `process_kline_data()`.
- **Priority:** High. Critical for data consistency across sources.
- **Action Items:**
  - Update `process_kline_data()` to reference a canonical schema definition that matches Vision API
  - Add validation that verifies REST API data against Vision API column specifications
  - Ensure numeric precision is consistent with Vision API (particularly important for price fields)

## Medium Priority & Medium Complexity

### 4. Auto-Limitation Based on Vision API Data Boundaries

- **Description:** Add intelligence to automatically limit data requests based on what's available in Vision API for the specific market type and symbol.
- **Low Hangingness:** Medium. Requires integration with Vision API constraints.
- **Priority:** Medium. Important for alignment but more complex.
- **Action Items:**
  - Create a utility function that checks Vision API data availability for symbol/interval combinations
  - Integrate this check into the `fetch()` method to reject or modify requests that exceed Vision API boundaries
  - Add warnings when users request data that approaches or exceeds Vision API limitations

### 5. Enhanced Error Classification and Recovery

- **Description:** Improve error handling to better classify and recover from errors, particularly those related to data availability limitations.
- **Low Hangingness:** Medium. Error handling exists but needs enhancement.
- **Priority:** Medium. Improves robustness and user experience.
- **Action Items:**
  - Create standardized error types that align with Vision API error classification
  - Implement more sophisticated retry logic for transient failures
  - Add detailed logging for data boundary violations to help users understand limitations

### 6. Performance Optimization for Large Historical Requests

- **Description:** Optimize performance when handling large historical data requests, particularly those approaching Vision API's data volumes.
- **Low Hangingness:** Medium. Code has chunking but could be optimized.
- **Priority:** Medium. Important for large data requests.
- **Action Items:**
  - Enhance chunking strategy to be more efficient for large time ranges
  - Implement more aggressive parallelization for requests that span multiple days/months
  - Add progress indicators for long-running operations

## Lower Priority Enhancements

### 7. Data Consistency Verification and Reporting

- **Description:** Add optional verification that compares samples of REST API data against Vision API data to ensure consistency.
- **Low Hangingness:** Higher complexity. Requires more substantial changes.
- **Priority:** Lower. Useful but not essential for basic alignment.
- **Action Items:**
  - Create a verification mode that can be enabled for testing
  - Implement sampling logic to avoid excessive overhead
  - Generate detailed reports of any discrepancies found

### 8. Documentation and Examples Update

- **Description:** Update documentation to clearly explain the alignment with Vision API data and limitations.
- **Low Hangingness:** Very low. Documentation only.
- **Priority:** Medium. Important for usability.
- **Action Items:**
  - Update docstrings throughout the code
  - Create examples showing proper usage within Vision API limitations
  - Add explicit warnings about data limitations by market type

## Important Implementation Considerations

1. **Maintain Interface Compatibility:** All changes must preserve the existing `DataSourceManager` interface to avoid disruption.

2. **Leverage Existing Utilities:** Use `TimeRangeManager`, `DataFrameValidator`, and other existing utilities rather than creating new ones.

3. **Respect Vision Data Delay:** Ensure the code acknowledges the ~48-hour delay in Vision API data availability and doesn't try to fetch too-recent data.

4. **Follow Existing Patterns:** Maintain consistency with the current codebase's patterns for validation, error handling, and logging.

5. **Gradual Integration:** Implement changes in small, testable increments to minimize risk of disruption.

6. **Testing Structure Separation:** Maintain a clear separation between testing environments:
   - All new interval support features (1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, etc.) must be tested in the `interval_new` test folder
   - The existing `interval_1s` test folder must be preserved exclusively for 1-second interval testing
   - When implementing new tests, use the fixtures and utilities already defined in the `interval_new/conftest.py` file

This enhanced roadmap focuses specifically on making the market data client more versatile while strictly adhering to Vision API's data availability constraints, exactly as you requested.
